tmpfile="/tmp/screen_$(date +%s).png"

# Select area and save screenshot
flameshot gui -r > "$tmpfile"

# Upload to your server
response=$(curl -s -X POST https://your.domain/ \
  -F "auth_key=changethis" \
  -F "file=@$tmpfile")

# Handle response
if [[ "$response" == http* ]]; then
  echo "$response" | xclip -selection clipboard
  notify-send "✅ Uploaded" "$response"
else
  notify-send "❌ Upload failed" "$response"
fi

rm -f "$tmpfile"
